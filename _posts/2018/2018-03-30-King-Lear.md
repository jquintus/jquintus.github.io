## Plot Summary

### Act 1

In which Lear fails to plan for his retirement.

#### Act 1 Scene 1

Lear decides to retire and splits up his kingdom amongst his daughters based on how much they love him. Turns out Goneril and Regan are good at professing their love.  Cordelia on the other hand is more plain spoken.  She gets the shaft.  Kent gets exiled.  France marries Cordelia.

#### Act 1 Scene 2

Edmund starts to make his dad think that Edgar is out to kill him for his inheritance.  Bastards gotta bastard.

#### Act 1 Scene 3

Goneril aint enjoying having her dad live with her.

#### Act 1 Scene 4

Lear starts to chafe at living with his daughter.  Kent comes back all disguised and ingratiates himself bak in with Lear.  Fools gotta fool.

#### Act 1 Scene 5

Lear heads off to his other daughter's place with the Fool.  Kent goes ahead as a messenger.

### Act 2

In which Lear realizes that he should have planned for his retirement

#### Act 2 Scene 1

Edmund scares Edgar into thinking that Glouchester has it out for him.  Fakes a fight with Edgar and Edgar flees.  Glouchester sees this as proof that Edgar was plotting against him and disowns his son.  Regan and Cornwall arrive and support Glouchester in this decision.

#### Act 2 Scene 2

Kent arrives at Glouchester's at the same time as Goneril's messenger and gets sassy with him.  Maybe a little too sassy since Cornwall has him put in the stocks.

#### Act 2 Scene 3

Edgar is evading pursuit.  Decides to dress up as a crazy beggar (Tom o' Bedlam) and go on the lam.

#### Act 2 Scene 4

Lear arrives to find his servant in the stocks and gets pissy about it.  Regan don't care.  Goneril arrives and double teams Lear with her sister.  They say as long as he is living under their roofs he has to give up his retinue of 100 knights.  Widdling it down to 50, then 25, then none.  Lear says F this and runs out into the storm.

### Act 3

In which Lear argues with the wind, which I'm guessing is the medieval equivalent of yelling at the T.V.

#### Act 3 Scene 1

Kent, looking for Lear, bumps into a "Gentleman" from Lear's retinue.  Tells him that all is not lost and that France is coming with Cordelia.  Scene ends with them going in seperate directions in search of Lear.

#### Act 3 Scene 2

Lear wanders around in the storm yelling at it and wallowing in self pity.  The Fool tries to cheer him up to no use.

#### Act 3 Scene 3

Glouchester frets over Lear being out in the storm.  Tells Edmund that he's going to help his erstwhile king.  Edgar's all like "cool.  cool cool cool." and then tells the audience that he's totally going to rat out his dad so that Cornwall will like him.

#### Act 3 Scene 4

Kent finds Lear and convinces him to seek shelter.  They stumble across a shack with Edmund in it who is pretending to be crazy.  Glouchester finds them and invites them all back to his pad for safety.
