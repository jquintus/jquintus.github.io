What open source projects are OK to use in a comercially distributed product?

## Good

* [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
* [MS-PL](https://opensource.org/licenses/MS-PL)
* [Apache](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)
* [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses)

## Bad

Some licenses are explicitly not OK to use. For example, the
[copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) licenses cannot be used in a
closed source project.  The following list is not exhaustive.  Just because a
license is not on the list does not automatically mean that it safe to use.

* [GPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)
* [LGPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/)
* [AGPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/)
* [MPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/)
* [Projects with no licenses specified](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/)

## Dual Licenses

It is possible for a project to have more than one license specified.  Unless
specified otherwise in their licensing, all clauses from all licenses apply.
This means that, to be safe, each license needs to be on the approved list.

## Other Licenses

Any other license must be evaluated on a case by case basis.

## More Information

The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) has lots of
useful information about OSS licensing.  [Choose A
License](https://choosealicense.com) does a great job of breaking down the most
common licenses comparing the differences between them.
