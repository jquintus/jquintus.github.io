This is my first post on my new blogging engine. I'm using [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) now.  So far I really like it.  It's nice and
easy.  I have been a big fan of markdown for some time now.  Rich text that I
can easily create in [vim](http://www.vim.org/)?  Yes please!  Creating
templates for pages and content that I can easily create by adding structured
data files to a folder?  Yes please!
