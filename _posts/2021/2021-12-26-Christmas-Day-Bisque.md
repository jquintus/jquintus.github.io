Leftover lobster and gravy from Christmas Eve can be made into a tasty bisque. This soup can be made in stages, with each componenet refrigerated. When you are ready for the soup, combine and let everything come up to temp, cooking the fresh seafood.

## Ingredients

* 4 - 6 quarts lobster gravy
* Seafood
  * leftover lobster (pick through the bodies and knuckles)
  * 1 pound shrimp (cut them in half if they are large)
  * 1 pound scallops
* Bechemel
  * 1 stick butter
  * 4 tablespoons flour
  * 2 cups milk
* Splash of cognac or white wine
* Salt and peper to taste

## Make the Béchamel Sauce

This can be done the night before and kept in the fridge until needed.

1. Melt the stick of butter with 4 table spoons of flour to make a roux
1. Slowly incorporate 2 cups of milk

## Reserve Lobster and Gravy

1. Reduce 6 to 8 quarts of lobster gravy (lobster removed) by about 1/3 so you have 4 to 6 quarts of lobster gravy remaining.
1. Pick through the remaining lobster to get leftover meat. The bodies and knuckles are the best source after Christmas Eve dinner. 
1. Combine lobster and gravy
1. Refrigerate over night if you don't want to make the bisque right away

## Assemble the Bisque

1. Bring the béchamel sauce back up to temp
1. Slowly incorporate the tomato sauce into the béchamel
  1. Mix in one laddle full at a time and stir
  1. Once three or so laddles are in, then you can dump the rest in
1. Add the uncooked seafood
1. Bring to temp
1. Add splash of cognac or white wine
1. Add salt and pepper
1. Simmer until thoroughly cooked.
