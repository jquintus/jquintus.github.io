# Cutting Wires

Last time, I built the [clock module](https://quintussential.com/archive/2020/08/15/Breadboard-Computer-1-Clock-Module/) for my 8-bit computer and I had a hell of a time cutting and stripping the wires just right. I could reliably cut the wires the right length, but then I couldn't take off exactly 0.3" of insulation on either side using my strippers. I had two options: get good or buy more reliable strippers.  

I went with the latter and picked up a set of [Knipex wire strippers](https://www.amazon.com/Knipex-1262180-Adjusting-Insulation-Strippers/dp/B003B8WB5U/). These things are amazing. Set the length to strip, insert wire, pull trigger, repeat.  The exact right ammount is stripped each and every time. No worries about setting the right gauge wire, it auto adjusts. Pure joy to work with after fumbling around last week.

They are a little on the pricey side but they will save me so much time and effort that they are worth it. I'd highly reccomend them if you can afford it.
