Since we started working remote I've been asking my team 1 "Question of the
Day" during standup. I started by posing the question at the start of the
meeting, but have since switched to asking before the meeting.  This gives
people some time to come up with better answers. I try to avoid asking for
"favorites" because that can put too much pressure on people to come up with
the right answer. So instead of "What's your favorite movie?" (which is
definitely on the list) I'd ask "What's a movie you've enjoyed recently?"

1. As a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
