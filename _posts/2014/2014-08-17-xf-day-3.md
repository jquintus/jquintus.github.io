title: "Xamarin.Froms: Images in Lists"
---

To recap, I’m writing a shopping cart app for Windows Phone, Android, and iOS.
The purpose of the app is primarily to let me use Forms.  Each post will build
on top of the previous one.

Last time I worked through some bugs in XF’s binding and cleaned up the layout
a bit.  Today the plan is to add product photos to make the list of products
and the product pages look prettier.

## Recap and Code

This is the fourth post in the series, you can find the rest here:

## Bugs fixed

Last week I ran into a [known
bug](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/19989/xamarin-forms-ui-not-properly-updated-when-binding-source-value-changed)
where XF wasn’t properly responding to IPropertyChaged events.  At the time
there was a fix in a beta build of Xamarin.Forms but I had trouble getting the
beta dlls to run in my app.  Since then the fix has been officially released.
So, I updated all my nuget packages; lo and behold binding now works as
expected.

Long story short:  Xamarin fixed the bug quickly and correctly.  Good for them.

## Cleaning the Data

A little nitpicky, but while playing with my app I noticed that the product
names don’t look like product names.  They are all lower cases and have odd
punctuation.  I wanted to clean this up quickly so I grabbed [Humanizer](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer) and
added some post processing on the client after loading the products.

```csharp
item.Name = item.Name
                .Titleize()
                .Replace(".", string.Empty);
item.Description = item.Description
                       .Humanize(LetterCasing.Sentence);
```

Now, if I want to show “product pictures” I’ll need to get those photos from
somewhere.  From an unrelated undertaking I had a list of 300+ photos from
[Imgur](http://imgur.com/).  Imgur also has a nice feature where you can request the image as an
icon or full size.  My data lives in a single string of json which is
deserialized at startup.  I want to be lazy and not update each item in that
list manually so I’m taking a shortcut.  I added the Imgur ids to a queue and
then in my post-process of the item, I add the icon and image urls.  Note the
“s” at the end of the IconUrl.  [That’s Imgur’s way](https://api.imgur.com/models/image) to specify a “small square”
icon.

```csharp
private static void UpdateItem(Product item, string imgurId)
{
    item.ImageUrl = string.Format("http://i.imgur.com/{0}.jpg", imgurId);
    item.IconUrl = string.Format("http://i.imgur.com/{0}s.jpg", imgurId);
}
```

Now that I have all my data, I’ll start displaying the photos.

## Inserting Images

I’m going to start with adding the image to the product page.  it’s just one
image on the page so it should be pretty simple.

```xml
<ScrollView>
  <StackLayout VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand" Padding="50">
 
    <Label Text="{Binding Product.Name}"
      HorizontalOptions="Center"
      Font="Bold,Large" />
 
    <Image Aspect="AspectFill"
            HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand"
            Source="{Binding Product.ImageUrl}" />
 
    <Label Text="{Binding Product.Description}"
      HorizontalOptions="Start"
      Font="Medium" />
 
    <Label Text="{Binding Product.Price, StringFormat='{0:c}'}"
      HorizontalOptions="Start"
      Font="Bold,Medium" />
 
  </StackLayout>
</ScrollView>
```

All I needed to do was add an Image element and bind the source to the
product’s ImagUrl property.  The image will automatically be downloaded and
cached for me.  According to the [documentation](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/working-with/images/) the cache lasts one day by
default but is configurable.  You can even turn the cache off.

This worked pretty well out of the box, everything loaded up very quickly.  The
only caveat is that some of my pictures are fairly long so the description and
text are pushed off the page.  Wrapping the entire StackLayout in a ScrollView
allows me to scroll down and see the rest of my content.

![](/images/posts/2014/2014-08-17-xf-day-3/screenshot.png)

Moving to the list view, all I do was bind against the IconUrl in the Product
model class. Remember, this is the smaller thumbnail provided to us by Imgur.

```xml
<ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Products}" ItemSelected="OnItemSelected">
  <ListView.ItemTemplate>
    <DataTemplate>
      <ViewCell>
        <StackLayout VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand" Orientation="Horizontal" Padding="10">
 
          <Image Aspect="AspectFill"
                 HeightRequest ="75" WidthRequest="75"
                 Source="{Binding IconUrl}" />
 
          <Label Text="{Binding Product.Name}" YAlign="Center" Font="Large" />
        </StackLayout>
      </ViewCell>
    </DataTemplate>
  </ListView.ItemTemplate>
</ListView>
```

I know I want the images to all be the same size so I set the width and height
to be 75 pixels. The Aspect property will do its best to show as much of the
image as possible, clipping it where needed.  As you can see, I also needed to
add a horizontal StackLayout because the data template now has two items in it.
I’ve also upped the text size from before, it was hard to click an item in the
list because it was too small.

Here’s the result:

It doesn’t look too bad, but there is a problem:  it takes a long time to load.
Since XF synchronously loads the images, the app is completely blank and
unresponsive for 2 to 5 seconds.

## Researching the Slow

The app hanging when loading a product list is unacceptable.  So the first
thing I did to counteract this was to take the network out of the equation.  I
added a loading image as a resource to the app.  Since I wanted the same image
on all platforms, I added it directly to the PCL project as an
EmbeddedResource.

![](/images/posts/2014/2014-08-17-xf-day-3/image1.png)

Just for testing, I modified my model to expose this image instead of the image
from the web and bound my view to that instead.

```csharp
public ImageSource IconSource
{
    get
    {
        string resource = "ShoppingCart.Resouces.placeholderImageSmall.png";
        return ImageSource.FromResource(resource);
    }
}
```

```xml
<Image Aspect="AspectFill"
       HeightRequest ="75" WidthRequest="75"
       Source="{Binding IconSource}" />
```

The resource path is separated by dots and includes the assembly name as well
as any sub folders.  In my example above, the file “placeholderImageSmall.png”
is in the “Resources” folder (which I created) in the “ShoppingCart” project.

With this change, the page loads instantly, but doesn’t look quite as nice
since every product is using the same placeholder image.

![](/images/posts/2014/2014-08-17-xf-day-3/screenshot2.png)

Since XF doesn’t do the load asynchronously, I need to figure out how to
display the loading icon while the image is downloaded from the web in the
background.

If I was in a pure WPF world, I’d use [Priority Binding](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms753174(v=vs.110).aspx).  This lets you set a
list of locations to get the binding value from, marking some as asynchronous.
Sadly, this is not supported in XF, so that’s right out.

So this means I need to roll it by hand.

## Speeding Things Up

I already have a class that manages binding to the result of a task.  I used
this last time for my product list which is (theoretically) coming from a slow
source.  It is Stephen Cleary’s [NotifyTaskCompletion](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn605875.aspx).  This is a good start,
but it returns null as the result until the task completes.  In my case I want
it to return a default value (my place holder image).  I tweak the constructor
and the result property just a touch to get the implementation I want.

```csharp
private readonly TResult _defaultResult;
 
public NotifyTaskCompletion(Task<TResult> task, TResult defaultResult = default(TResult))
{
    _defaultResult = defaultResult;
    Task = task;
 
    if (!task.IsCompleted)
    {
        var _ = WatchTaskAsync(task);
    }
}
 
public TResult Result
{
    get
    {
        return (Task.Status == TaskStatus.RanToCompletion)
          ? Task.Result
          : _defaultResult;
    }
}
```

The constructor now takes the default value, with a default value of
default(TResult) so we don’t break any existing uses of the class.

Next a few helpers to make using this for images simple:

```csharp
public static class AsyncImageSource
{
    public static NotifyTaskCompletion<ImageSource> FromTask(Task<ImageSource> task, ImageSource defaultSource)
    {
        return new NotifyTaskCompletion<ImageSource>(task, defaultSource);
    }
 
    public static NotifyTaskCompletion<ImageSource> FromUriAndResource(string uri, string resource)
    {
        var u = new Uri(uri);
        return FromUriAndResource(u, resource);
    }
 
    public static NotifyTaskCompletion<ImageSource> FromUriAndResource(Uri uri, string resource)
    {
        var t = Task.Run(() => ImageSource.FromUri(uri));
        var defaultResouce = ImageSource.FromResource(resource);
 
        return FromTask(t, defaultResouce);
    }
}
```

All this is doing, is creating (and running) a task to download the images in
the background and feeding that into the NotifyTaskCompletion.  One caveat here
is that even if nothing ever binds to the image, it will still be downloaded.
The ProductViewModel can now expose the IconUrl as an asynchronous wrapper
around an ImageSource

```
public class ProductViewModel : BaseViewModel
{
    private const string _resource = "ShoppingCart.Resources.placeholderImageSmall.png";
    public ProductViewModel(Product product)
    {
        Product = product;
        IconSource = AsyncImageSource.FromUriAndResource(product.IconUrl, _resource);
    }
 
    public NotifyTaskCompletion<ImageSource> IconSource { get; private set; }
 
    public Product Product
    {
        get { return GetValue<Product>(); }
        set { SetValue(value); }
    }
}
```

The ProductsListViewModel will have to expose a list of the ProductViewModel
instead of just the raw model which is a shame.  I like binding to the model
whenever possible just so I don’t have to worry about passing view models
around.  But what can you do?  And now in the view, we bind to the result of
the IconSource like so:

```xml
<Image Aspect="AspectFill"
       HeightRequest ="75" WidthRequest="75"
       Source="{Binding IconSource.Result}" />
```

## Expectations and Realities

Running up the app my expectation would be to see the loading images when you
first go to the product list pages and over the course of 2 to 5 seconds have
them change to the correct product images as they are downloaded.  In reality,
when I navigated to a page all of the photos were present immediately.  Right
away.  No delay.  No loading images.

Happy coding.
