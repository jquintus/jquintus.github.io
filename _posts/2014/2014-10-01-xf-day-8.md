title: "Xamarin.Froms: Writing to Disk With Akavache"
---

To recap, I’m writing a shopping cart app for Windows Phone, Android, and iOS.  The purpose of the app is primarily to let me use Forms.  Each post will build on top of the previous one.

Last time I added behaviors to my XF xaml.  This week I’m going to save settings to disk using Akavache.

Once I started writing the post to go along with this week’s post, I quickly became aware that the it was longer than what really makes sense for a single post.  So I’m splitting the article in two.  This week will be logging in, next week will be logging out.  Both weeks will use the same code.  For consistency’s sake, I’ll be creating a new release for next week, even though it will point to the same code.

Recap and Code

## Installing Akavache Cheat Sheet

At the risk of spoiling the narrative below, here’s a very brief outline of the steps to install and use Akavache in a Xamarin Forms app.  For links and more details, continue reading.

1. Install Akavache package in common PCL project (Install-Package akavache)
1. Install Akavache package in platform specific projects
   1. Droid
   1. Win Phone
   1. iOS (The iOS step is assumed to be necessary and sufficient to make Akavache work, but I am unable to verify it)
1. **WinPhone**: Update Splat package (Update-Package splat)
1. W**inPhone**:  Change build configuration to x86

## Logging In

From the beginning one of the things that really bothered me about this app is
that I have to log in each time I use it.  And that’s including the fact that I
don’t have to type in a particular username/password.  Any text will do.  I
guess I’m just lazy.

To persist logging in, I’m just going to write a little bit of information to
disk when I’m logging in for the first time.  Next time I open the app, I’ll
just check for that value, if it exists I’ll go straight to the main landing
page.

I don’t want to tie my implementation down to an unknown framework, so the
first thing I need to do is create an interface to abstract away persisting
data:

```csharp
public interface ICache
{
    Task<T> GetObject<T>(string key);
    Task InsertObject<T>(string key, T value);
    Task RemoveObject(string key);
}
```

This interface should handle all of my [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations.  Right now the only
person that needs to use it is my LoginService.

```csharp
public async Task<User> LoginAsync(string username, string password)
{
    User user = Login(username, password);
 
    await _cache.InsertObject("LOGIN", user);
 
    return user;
}
 
public async Task<bool> IsLoggedIn()
{
    User user = await _cache.GetObject<User>("LOGIN");
    return user != null;
}
```

LoginAsync performs the standard log in check, verifying that username and
password are valid credentials (in reality it just checks that they are
non-null) and returns a user object if they are valid.  I then save that in the
cache using “LOGIN” as the key.  Next, IsLoggedIn in checks to see if there is
a non-null value stored in the cache.

Now that we know how the cache is going to be used, let’s implement it.

## Akavache

I’ll be using [Akavache](https://github.com/akavache/Akavache) as my data store.  It’s probably a bit overkill for the
very simple use case I have but I have a few reasons why I want to use it.
First, I really don’t want to think about where exactly I’m storing this data.
It could be in a database, it could be on disk, my app doesn’t really care.
It’s just a set of keys and values to me.  While Akavache does use a SQLite
backend, I don’t have to know any of the details.  I’m also looking for
something that is async/await friendly.  Akavache supports many platforms, I’d
love to be able to write this once for all platforms.  And finally, I recently
heard about it and kind of wanted to play with it.

Here’s a summary of what I just stated above as my reasons for using Akavache

* Abstract away storage details
* async API
* Cross platform
* It’s new to me

## Akavache on Droid
Akavache is a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/akavache/), so
installation is easy.  I’m installing the package into the core project
(ShoppingCart.csproj).  For it to work it also needs to be installed on the
Droid project as well.  In my Services folder I’ll add my Akavache
implementation of ICache.  This class will be used by all of the platforms.

```csharp
using Akavache;
using ShoppingCart.Services;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Reactive.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
 
namespace ShoppingCart.Services
{
    public class Cache : ICache
    {
        public Cache()
        {
            BlobCache.ApplicationName = "ShoppingCart";
        }
 
        public async Task RemoveObject(string key)
        {
            await BlobCache.LocalMachine.Invalidate(key);
        }
 
        public async Task<T> GetObject<T>(string key)
        {
            try
            {
                return await BlobCache.LocalMachine.GetObject<T>(key);
            }
            catch (KeyNotFoundException)
            {
                return default(T);
            }
        }
 
        public async Task InsertObject<T>(string key, T value)
        {
            await BlobCache.LocalMachine.InsertObject(key, value);
        }
    }
}
```

First thing to note here is that I’m importing the System.Reactive.Linq
namespace.  This enables us to await the Akavache calls.  Next thing to note is
that I’m setting the ApplicationName property in the constructor.  This is
needed to initialize storage.  The rest of the implementation is pretty
straight forward.  You can even see that I got most of my method names from the
Akavache API.

The RemoveObject implementation invalidates the object in Akavache.  GetObject
tries to read the object from the cache, catching any KeyNotFoundExceptions.

Next week I’ll go over how all of this gets plugged into the UI.

## Akavache on Win Phone

Akavache is a bit more fiddly on Win Phone.

To start off, install the [Akavache nuget
package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/akavache/) directly in the Win Phone
project.  Remember, it’s already installed in my PCL project where it is being
used, it needs to be installed here as well, even though none of the code
reference it directly.  At this point, I get my first error:

```
System.TypeInitializationException was unhandled by user code
  HResult=-2146233036
  Message=The type initializer for 'Akavache.BlobCache' threw an exception.
  Source=Akavache

       Source=Akavache
       StackTrace:

       InnerException:

There is an assembly that can’t be found.
[Splat](https://github.com/paulcbetts/splat) is a another package produced by
Paul Betts (the producer of Akavache).  The problem here is not that the file
isn’t there, but that it’s an older version.  All I need to do is update the
nuget package for Splat and I’m good.

With this resolved, the next exception I get is that correct version of SQLitePcl.Raw is missing.

```
System.TypeInitializationException was unhandled by user code
  HResult=-2146233036
  Message=The type initializer for 'Akavache.Sqlite3.Internal.SQLiteConnection' threw an exception.

       StackTrace:

       InnerException:

Again this is a [nuget
package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SQLitePCL.raw_basic/), but this time
updating does not fix the problem.  I reached out to Paul about the issue and
he told me that I have to change the build configuration of the Win Phone
project to specify x86 as my platform.

Now running the app will work.

## Thanks

A big thanks to [Paul Betts](https://github.com/paulcbetts) both for writing Akavache and for providing the last
mile of help when I needed it.

Happy Coding
