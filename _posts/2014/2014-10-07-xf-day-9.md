To recap, I’m writing a shopping cart app for Windows Phone, Android, and iOS.
The purpose of the app is primarily to let me use Forms.  Each post will build
on top of the previous one.

Last time I wrote data to disk.  This week I’m going to add an application
level menu.

Reminder, this article is a direct continuation of [last week’s
article](/archive/2014/10/01/xf-day-8/).  The code base is entirely the same.
The posts were split up so that neither would be too long.  For consistency’s
sake, I have created separate releases for each week.

## Recap and Code

## Logging Out

Now that I’m all logged in, I need to be able to log out. Ideally this would go
in a dedicated page with various settings. But honestly, that’d be boring. This
app already has plenty of pages.  What it doesn’t have is a system level menu —
an [Action Bar](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html) on
Droid or an [App
Bar](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/ff431813(v=vs.105).aspx)
on Windows Phone.

Adding the menu is rather straight forward, just some simple XAML and bindings
to CategoriesListPage.xaml:

```xml
<ContentPage.ToolbarItems>
  <ToolbarItem Name="Log Out" Command="{Binding LogOut}" Order="Primary" Priority="0">
    <ToolbarItem.Icon>
      <OnPlatform x:TypeArguments="FileImageSource"
                  WinPhone="Assets/Logout.png"
                  Android="ic_action_logout.png" />
    </ToolbarItem.Icon>
  </ToolbarItem>
</ContentPage.ToolbarItems>
```

Conveniently, ToolbarItem has a Command property that you can bind against to
handle clicks.   The command binds the same as a button.  The icon is a bit
more involved.

Now the question is: where can I get good icons for my app?  This leads me to a
quick aside…

## Windows Phone Icons

The easiest way to get icons for a Windows Phone or Metro-style Windows apps is
to use [Metro Studio by
Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio).  First off, it’s
free.  Second off, it’s full of great icons.  Just search for whatever you
want, and then  customize it for your uses.  You can even create icons out of
text in whatever font you like.  Finally, a use for Wingdings.

## Android Icons

Metro Studio packs a lot of punch, but doesn’t offer any help for Android apps
(kinda makes sense given the name).  For Android assets, check out the [Android
Asset Studio](http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html).  There’s a lot of good stuff in here, but for this project I went
straight to the [Action Bar and Tab Icons](http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-actionbar.html) section.  They provide a library of
images (although significantly smaller than Metro Studio), the ability to
upload an image of your choice, or to enter an arbitrary string (and we still
get Wingdings!).  The best part is that it generates a zip with assets for
various screen resolutions.  Just unzip and drop the folders into the Resources
directory.

## Image Asset Locations

```xml
<ToolbarItem.Icon>
  <OnPlatform x:TypeArguments="FileImageSource"
              WinPhone="Assets/Logout.png"
              Android="ic_action_logout.png" />
</ToolbarItem.Icon>
```

Because I’m specifying the location of the icon as a string, I need to make
sure that the images are placed in the correct locations in the corresponding
project folders.  The [XF documentation](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/working-with/images/#Local_Images) explains pretty clearly where each goes.

For my WinPhone project, I place the Logout.png in the “Assets” folder.

Android is a little bit more complicated since the platform allows you to serve
[different sized images for devices with different resolutions](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html).  Each file is
put in the corresponding drawable folder under “Resources”.  As I said earlier,
the Android Asset Studio does all this for you.  You can just drop the folders
it generates directly into the Resources folder.

## Doing Async Work at Startup

Previously, when the app started up it went directly to the login screen.  Now
it has to first check to see if the user is logged in.  If they are then the
app goes to the categories page, otherwise it goes to the login page.  This is
easy, except for the fact that the check happens on the background thread and
takes some time since it is going to disk.  Not a lot of time, but enough that
we aren’t guaranteed to get the result back before the app is ready to start
up.  In order to accommodate this, I’m turning the “WelcomePage” into a splash
page.  It will display a progress dialog for a little bit and then navigate to
the next page once it knows which page that is.  Let’s start with the view:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             x:Class="ShoppingCart.Views.WelcomePage"
             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:ShoppingCart;assembly=ShoppingCart"
             BindingContext="{x:Static local:App.WelcomeViewModel}"
             BackgroundColor="White">
 
  <StackLayout VerticalOptions="Center"
               IsVisible="{Binding IsLoaded, Mode=OneWayToSource}">
    <Frame>
      <Label Text="Welcome to The Store"
             Font="Bold, Large"
             HorizontalOptions="Center"
             TextColor="{x:Static local:App.AccentColor}" />
    </Frame>
 
    <ActivityIndicator IsRunning="{Binding IsBusy.IsNotCompleted}"
                       HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand"
                       VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand"
                       Color="{x:Static local:App.AccentColor}" />
  </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```

The ActivityIndicator starting on line 18 is pretty straight forward.  I bind
whether or not it is running to the NotifyTaskCompletion property on the view
model (more on that later), and the color to the static representation of the
accent color in the same way that I do for the label.  You should remember this
from the [styling article](/archive/2014/09/08/xf-day-6) from a couple of weeks ago.

A little more interesting is the one way to source binding on the visibility of
the stack layout.  This is here to tell the view model that the view has been
displayed.  Since this is the first page in the XF app it is wrapped in the
NavigationPage, which initializes the NavigationService.  If we try to navigate
away from this view before it is shown, we have no navigation service, and so
navigation won’t work.  Classic Catch-22.

```csharp
public class WelcomeViewModel : BaseViewModel
{
    private readonly IAppNavigation _navi;
    private SemaphoreSlim _slim;
 
    public WelcomeViewModel(IAppNavigation navi)
    {
        _navi = navi;
        _slim = new SemaphoreSlim(0, 1);
        IsBusy = new NotifyTaskCompletion<int>(GoToFirstPage());
    }
 
    public NotifyTaskCompletion<int> IsBusy { get; private set; }
 
    public bool IsLoaded
    {
        get { return GetValue<bool>(); }
        set
        {
            SetValue(value);
            if (value)
            {
                _slim.Release();
            }
        }
    }
 
    private async Task<int> GoToFirstPage()
    {
        await _slim.WaitAsync();
        await _navi.SecondPage();
        return 0;
    }
}
```

The first thing the view model does is initialize a [SemaphoreSlim](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.semaphoreslim(v=vs.110).aspx) in the
unsignaled state, i.e., calling Wait() will block.  It then creates a
[NotifyTaskCompletion](http://blog.masterdevs.com/xf-day-2/) of type int.  Creating this kicks off the async call to
GoToFirstPage.  The return value doesn’t matter in this case, the object is
just being used to run a background task and update the UI with the status.

When IsLoaded is set to true by the binding to the visibility of the
StackLayout in the view, it signals the [semaphore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)), allowing the WaitAsync in
GoToFirstPage to complete.  GoToFirstPage then tells the navigation service to
show the second page in the app.  The navigation service handles the logic of
determining which page to show as well as actually navigating to the page.  For
the sake of demonstration, I’ve added a delay in the video below.

Here’s what the app looks like when the user needs to log in

And here’s what the returning a user sees
