title: "Xamarin.Froms: Search and Barcode Scanner"
---

To recap, I’m writing a shopping cart app for Windows Phone, Android, and iOS.  The purpose of the app is primarily to let me use Forms.  Each post will build on top of the previous one.

Last time I worked I added asynchronously loaded images to a list view.  Today
I plan on adding a product search that uses a barcode scanner using the [ZXing
component](https://components.xamarin.com/view/zxing.net.mobile).

## Recap and Code
This is the fifth post in the series, you can find the rest here:

## Search
Before I implement search with a barcode, it’ll be easier if I add a search
box.  For now, I’ll just add it on the categories page.  This should be simple,
I’ll throw up a text box and a button.

```xml
<StackLayout VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand" Orientation="Horizontal">
  <Entry Text="{Binding SearchTerm}"
         Placeholder="Search"
         HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand" />
  <Button Text ="Search"
    Command="{Binding SearchCommand}" />
</StackLayout>
```

Next I wire them into the view model.

```csharp
private readonly RelayCommand _searchCommand;
 
public CategoriesListViewModel(IProductService service, INavigationService navi)
{
    _searchCommand = new RelayCommand(async () =>
    {
        var items = (await _service.Search(SearchTerm))
                    .OrderByDescending(i => i.Rating)
                    .ToList();
 
        if (items != null && items.Any())
        {
            Page page = items.Count == 1
                 ? page = App.GetProductPage(items.First())
                 : page = App.GetProductsListPage(items, SearchTerm);
 
            await _navi.PushAsync(page);
            SearchTerm = string.Empty;
        }
        else
        {
            await _navi.DisplayAlert("Error", "No results for search " + SearchTerm);
        }
    },
    () => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(SearchTerm));
}
 
public ICommand SearchCommand { get { return _searchCommand; } }
 
public string SearchTerm
{
    get { return GetValue<string>(); }
    set
    {
        SetValue(value);
        _searchCommand.RaiseCanExecuteChanged();
    }
}
```

If our search has exactly one result, then we go directly to that product page;
if there are multiple results, we show them in a list.

The ProductService already has a stub for search, but was only half
implemented.

```csharp
public async Task<List<Product>> Search(string searchString)
{
    var items = await _itemsAsync;
 
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(searchString)) return items;
 
    searchString = searchString.ToLower();
    var filterd = items.Where(i => i.Name.ToLower().Contains(searchString))
                       .ToList();
 
    return filterd;
}
```

## Adding a Component

The first step in using a component is to add it to your project.  Right click
on the “Components” folder in your Droid or iOS project and select “Ge More
Components…”

![](/images/posts/2014/2014-08-25-xf-day-4/image2.png)

I searched for a barcode scanner and got a list of packages.  ZXing sounds
familiar and supports all platforms so I go with that.

![](/images/posts/2014/2014-08-25-xf-day-4/image3.png)

Window’s phone is a little simpler in that I can just download the package from
NuGet:

```
Install-Package ZXing.Net.Mobile
```

## Using a Component

Since each platform references its own implementation of the barcode scanner
software, I now need to create a device agnostic interface in the common
project.

```csharp
public interface IScanner
{
    Task<ScanResult> Scan();
}
 
public class ScanResult
{
    public string Text { get; set; }
}
```

I then implement these interfaces for each of the platforms.

Android first:

```csharp
public class DroidScanner : IScanner
{
    public async Task<ScanResult> Scan()
    {
        var scanner = new MobileBarcodeScanner(Forms.Context)
        {
            UseCustomOverlay = false,
            BottomText = "Scanning will happen automatically",
            TopText = "Hold your camera about \n6 inches away from the barcode",
        };
 
        var result = await scanner.Scan();
 
        return new ScanResult
        {
            Text = result.Text,
        };
    }
}
```

The MobileBarcodeScanner takes the current instance of the Android context.
Because this is a common requirement in Android API’s Xamarin exposes the
current context in the static property Forms.Context.

WindowsPhone is essentially the same, just a different constructor:

```csharp
public class WinPhoneScanner : IScanner
{
    public async Task<ScanResult> Scan()
    {
        var scanner = new MobileBarcodeScanner(MainPage.DispatcherSingleton)
        {
            UseCustomOverlay = false,
            BottomText = "Scanning will happen automatically",
            TopText = "Hold your camera about \n6 inches away from the barcode",
        };
 
        var result = await scanner.Scan();
 
        return new ScanResult
        {
            Text = result.Text,
        };
    }
}
```

Next I register the device specific implementations with the XF
DependencyService.  In my Droid project I create a file called
ServiceRegistration and add the following lines

```csharp
using ShoppingCart.Droid.Services;
 
[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency(typeof(DroidScanner))]
```

A similar file is created for WP:

```csharp
using ShoppingCart.WinPhone.Services;
 
[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency(typeof(WinPhoneScanner))]
```

Now to create an instance of IScanner I resolve it from the DependencyService:

```csharp
IScanner scanner = DependencyService.Get<IScanner>();
```

Now all I have to do is wire up a new button to to launch the scanner and use
the results.

```csharp
ScanCommand = new RelayCommand(async () =>
{
    var result = await _scanner.Scan();
 
    SearchTerm = result.Text;
    Search();
});
```

The scan command just calls into the search implementation I wrote above.

## Adding Permissions

And finally, I just need to add in the permission to access the camera,
otherwise the barcode scanner component won’t be able to start up at all.  On
Windows phone open up the WMAppManifest, switch to the Capabilities tab, and
make sure that `ID_CAP_ISV_CAMERA` is checked.

![](/images/posts/2014/2014-08-25-xf-day-4/image.png)

Or just edit the file by hand and add the permission by hand.

```xml
<Capability Name="ID_CAP_ISV_CAMERA" />
```

Android is similar. Right click the project, select Properties, go to the
Android Manifest tab, and select `CAMERA` in the Required permissions section.

![](/images/posts/2014/2014-08-25-xf-day-4/image1.png)

Again, you can do this manually by editing the AndroidManifest.xml file directly and adding the CAMERA permission.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:installLocation="auto">
  <uses-sdk />
  <application></application>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
</manifest>
```

Happy coding
