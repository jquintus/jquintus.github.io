*Most of this (all of it) was stolen from Ron's response to me asking a
question on slack.* 

Took me about a month of raging when I first switched to OSX. These tips might
help:

## Finder keyboard 

They actually feel more rational to me than Explorer now tbh.

* Cmd+up/down to move up and down the tree. Doing it on a file opens it. Vs
* Explorer, you have to switch to Enter to open a file.  Hitting enter on a
* file (or most labels really) initiates a rename vs F2

## In general:

* Cmd+Space is your friend
* As Kevin mentioned, Cmd instead of Ctrl. I actually prefer this now since I
  can use my thumbs for Cmd instead of my pinkies for Ctrl (my thumbs are
  usually out of play for keyboard shortcuts anyway). Think Cmd+A vs Ctrl+A
* Cut/Paste flow is different. It’s more like Copy/Move and Move is considered
  a modification to Paste, so copy as usual (CMD+C), then modify Paste into a
  Move with Option (Option + CMD +V)
* Option modifies all sorts of things, and they aren’t well documented. Try
  option clicking everything I guess. E.g. after right clicking on a folder in
  Finder to show the context menu, you can hold down Option to show additional
  command variations
* You can drag files from anywhere into an Open File dialog and the dialog will
  jump to that path with that file selected. Versus Windows, last time I used
  it, doing that will just freak it out.
* If you hate excessive clicking like me (and it sounds like @brewdente also),
  turn on triple finger dragging, which lets you just do a 3 finger touch to
  drag windows around.  Otherwise, you have to do a full click, hold it down, and
  drag.  It’s oddly hidden in Accessibility now.
* You can change touch to be equivalent to click, so it’s more akin to a smart
  phone (I hate clicking)
* Turn on the speaker and bluetooth icons. All those status icons are hidden by
  default. You can turn them all on in System Preferences. This lets you
  quickly switch inputs and outputs.
* If you Option click the Notification icon in the top right (looks like a
  modified hamburger icon), it’ll snooze your notifications. Great for when
  you’re presenting off your mac and you don’t want random calendar invites
  appearing
* There are a lot of 3rd party windows managers if the OS ones aren’t sufficient, like Magnet
* Install this if you want a soothing screen saver: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial

## Windows management

* Full screen is weird on macOs and defaults to launching an addtl desktop for
  it. If you’re into multiple desktops, I guess that’s fine, but I never used
  them under either OS.
* If you DO like multidesktops, click and drag an app to the top and beyond
  (like you’re trying to go off screen with it). It’ll prompt you to move the
  app into a different desktop.
* Not sure if this was ever added to Windows, but same thing, if you move your
  mouse to the edge of an app, you get the resize icon. but if you double click
  instead, it’ll go full screen in that direction only.
* Hold down the green full screen button on an app to trigger side by side
  mode. You can also use the drag up technique I mentioned above to trigger the
  same effect on a different desktop if there’s already a full screen app on it
* Triple finger swipe down on the touch pad will show all open windows for the
  current app only
* Closing all windows is *not* equivalent to exiting the app. Not sure if MS
  ever changed that for Windows, but it drove me crazy whenever I accidentally
  closed my only browser window and it defaulted to exiting out. Cmd+Q to
  actually exit an app.

Hope that helps.
