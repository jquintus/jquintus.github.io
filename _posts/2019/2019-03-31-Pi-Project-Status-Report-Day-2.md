On day 2 I started complaining to a friend that
I kept burning out my GPIO ports and that they
didn't work properly.  He helpfully suggested
that I may not have had the pins plugged in to
the correct spots.  

After telling him that there was no way that I
was plugging the things in wrong since I was
using the [Adafruit Pi
Cobbler](https://www.adafruit.com/product/914),
I took a closer look and realized that I had
plugged the wrong end of the cable into the Pi.
The gray stripe needs to be near the bottom of
the board, where the SD card reader is. I then
took a Sharpie and labeled the ends of the
cable so I don't make this mistake again in the
future. Or at least to make it less likely.

Mystery solved.
