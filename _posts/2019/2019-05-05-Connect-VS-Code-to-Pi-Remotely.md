I've wanted to have a proper IDE environment on my Windows machine that can execute code on my Raspberry Pi. Turns out that there's a new VS Code extension that purports to do just that.  Except if you read the fine print it currently only supports an x86_64 Linux-based OS.

But still, it's worth keeping an eye on the [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension.  It's new as of a few days ago and I expect that they'll make improvements and allow more environments over time.
