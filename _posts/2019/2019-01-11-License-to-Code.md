It can be tricky to know what you can and can't use when looking at
free libraries.  The following is a quick rule of thumb for Open
Source Licenses.

## Good

* [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
* [MS-PL](https://opensource.org/licenses/MS-PL)
* [Apache](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)
* [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses)

## Bad

Some licenses are explicitly not OK to use. For example, none of the
[copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) licenses can be
used in a closed source project.  The following list is not
exhaustive.  Just because a license is not on the list does not
automatically mean that it can be used.

* [GPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)
* [LGPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/)
* [AGPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/)
* [MPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/)
* [Projects with no licenses specified](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/)

## Dual Licenses

It is possible for a project to have more than one license specified.
Unless specified otherwise in their licensing, all clauses from all
licenses may apply.  This means that, to be safe, each license to be
on the compatible with the consuming project.  

## Other Licenses

Any other license must be evaluated on a case by case basis.

## More Information

The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) has
lots of useful information about OSS licensing.  [Choose A
License](https://choosealicense.com) does a great job of breaking
down the most common licenses comparing the differences between them.
