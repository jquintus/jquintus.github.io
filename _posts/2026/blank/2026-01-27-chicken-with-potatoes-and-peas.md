# Roast Chicken Thighs, Potatoes & Peas (One Pan)

Oven: 425°F
Pan: metal roasting pan / sheet pan

## Ingredients
* 4–6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 2 lb potatoes (Yukon Gold or russet), 1½” chunks
* 1 medium yellow onion, thick wedges
* ¾–1 cup frozen peas
* ¼ cup dry white wine
* 1–2 small rosemary sprigs
* Olive oil, salt, pepper

## Method
1.	**Potatoes first**
    * Toss potatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper.
    * Roast 20–25 min, cut-side down, until browned.
2.	**Chicken + onions**
    * Season chicken. Add thighs (skin up) and onion wedges.
    * Roast 15–20 min until fat is rendering.
3.	Wine + rosemary
    * Pull pan. Splash ¼ cup wine against pan edge.
    * Add rosemary. Return to oven immediately.
4.	**Peas**
    * Scatter frozen peas over pan.
    * Roast 8–10 min more.
5.	**Finish**
    * Optional broil 2–3 min.
    * Remove rosemary. Rest 5 min, toss once, serve.

## Notes

* If it doesn’t sizzle when wine hits, pan wasn’t hot enough
* Crowding is good — potatoes should sit in fat
* No liquid left at the end = correct
