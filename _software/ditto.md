Ditto starts up with Windows and quietly keeps track of your clipboard.  I tend
to use it to get back the last thing I had in my clipboard before I accidently
copied over it, but it can do a lot more.  It stores more of my clipboard
history than I think I'd ever need.  What's more, it can sync cliboards between
computers and has support for images.
