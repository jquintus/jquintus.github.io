TrueCrypt lets you create an encrypted file that you can then mount like a thumb
drive.  All files stored on that drive are encrypted on disk.  Because it's fully
encrypted you can safely put the TrueCrypt file in your OneDrive or DropBox.

TrueCrypt is no longer being supported.  [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/)
is a continuation of the project by a different team.  I have not had a chance
to use it though.
