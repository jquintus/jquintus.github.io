[Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org) is like apt-get for windows.
It gives you a command line tool to quickly and easily download and install
programs and tools.  Chocolatey is the best.
And to make it better, check out [Boxstarter](http://boxstarter.org/).

But I digress.
Chocolatey GUI gives you a UI on top of Chocolatey, showing you what you have
installed and letting you search for more programs.
