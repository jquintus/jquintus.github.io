You ever wish CMD in windows didn't suck so hard? So did Martin Ridgers,
but unlike you, he did something about it.  Among a whole host of other
features, Clink allows you to paste into a CMD window using CTRL-V and saves
command history between sessions.  Mixed with [cmder](#cmder) and
[ConEmu](#conEmu) to make an amazing console experience in windows.
