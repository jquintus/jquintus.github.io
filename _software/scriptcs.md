Use C# as a scripting engine.

I mostlty used this as a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
for C#, testing small snippets of code to see if they worked just right.
A common case would be when I need to find the correct format string for a date.

Since the [C# Interactive Window](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Interactive-Window)
became available in Visual Studio 2015, I've found myself using that instead.
