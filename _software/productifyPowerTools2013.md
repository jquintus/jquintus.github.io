Productivity Power Tools adds a bunch of great features into Visual Studio 2017.
To be honest, the plugin integrates so seamlessly that I have a hard time knowing
which features come from this plugin and which are native to VS.

There's a long list, but here are some of my favorites:

* [Ctrl+Click GoTo Definition](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.CtrlClickGoToDefinition)
    * Turns method calls and types into hyperlinks to their files
* [Custom Document Well](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.CustomDocumentWell)
    * Improved the tab bar across the top of the main window
* [Fix Mixed Tabs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.FixMixedTabs)
    * Detects when a document has oth tabs and spaces
    * Converts all tabs into spaces to keep your formatting consistent
* [Match Margin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.MatchMargin)
    * Click on any word in the document and all instances of it become highlighted
      in the scroll bar
* [Solution Error Visualizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.SolutionErrorVisualizer)
    * Any files with errors or warnings are shown in Solution Explorer with a
    squiggle underneeth
* [Time Stamp Margin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.TimeStampMargin)
    * All output in the debug window is prepended with a datestamp.  Simple but useul.
