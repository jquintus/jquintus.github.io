Atlassian's free GUI client for Git.  It's pretty easy to use and intuitive.  It's
a good compliment to the command line.  In general I find it useful to use both a
GUI and the Git command line.  There are some things that are just easier in one
or the other.

I've stopped using this as much since Visual Studio started including Git tooling
in the IDE.
