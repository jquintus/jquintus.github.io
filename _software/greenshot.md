Simple and free screenshot tool.  Binds to `PrtScn` so you don't even have to
remember that you're using it.  By default it will let you select the region
of the screen to capture (instead of just capturing **everything**).  Once captured
you are asked what you want to do:

* Copy to the clipboard (a perenial favorite)
* Open it in the greenshot image editor (more full featured than you'd expect)
* Open it in your prefered image editor
* Upload to Imgur
* Emai, print, open it in Office, etc

You even have a whole host of other ways to capture

* A selection (my default)
* The entire screen
* A specific window
* The same region as before (this is great if you want to capture a sequence of images)
