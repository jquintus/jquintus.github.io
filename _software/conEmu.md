ConEmu is not a felonious Australian bird, it's a console emulator.  It's like cmd, in the same way that a Ferrari is like a broken down Pinto.  Sure, technically, they are both cars and will both (probably) get you where you're going.  But with one you'll actually enjoy the ride and not want to pull over to the side of the road and abandon the goal just to get away from this god awful experience.
