ConEmu is not a felonious Australian bird, it's a 
console emulator.  It's like cmd (the Windows command line) the same way 
a Ferrari is like a busted up old Pinto.  Sure
, technically, they are both cars and will both 
(probably) get you where you're going.  But with 
one you'll actually enjoy the ride and not want 
to pull over to the side of the road and abandon
 the goal just to get away from this god awful 
 experience.
