One of the best markdown editors I've used... when it works.  After
reinstalling it on my work machine, it stopped rendering markdown.  But other
than that, this tool is a champ.  Fast editing in a split pane.  Type in to the
left side and it's rendered out on the right.  It even supports GitHub flavored
markdown, so you knwo just how your README's and project wiki entries will
render.

Despite the issues, I've gladly shelled out money and use the licensed version
of this app.
