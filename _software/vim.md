An elegant editor for a more civilized age.  There are other text editors
available.  Heck, I use the Visual Studio editor for the vast majority of my
development work.  But when it comes down to it, vim is just faster at editing
than anything else I've seen.  It's easily scriptable and the modal nature
mixed with repeat key make it just too easy to use (once you get the hang of
it).
