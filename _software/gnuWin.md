All of the GNU commands you could ever want from linux recompiled for Windows.
This isn't some fake environment like [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) that
pretends you're using Linux.  This puts all the commands you know and love but
in your standard terminal.  

Installation is simple.  Just drop a bunch of .exe's into a folder and add that
folder to your path.  Done.  You want to remove it?  Delete the folder.  

If you really want to run real Linux programs on Windows check out [Ubuntu on
Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).
