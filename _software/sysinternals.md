A whole suite of great command line and GUI applications for digging into your
Windows computer.  If you need more information about something on your computer
chances are you'll be able to find it with one of these tools.

Some examples:

* [PsList](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/pslist)
    * A command line utility to show you all the running processes
* [MoveFile](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/pendmoves)
    * Ever have a problem where you can't move or delete a file because it's
      currently in use? movefile will schedule it to be moved on your next
      reboot before anyone else has a chance to lock it up.
* [Process Explorer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processexplorer)
    * The Task Manager on crack.
